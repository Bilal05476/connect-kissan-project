    <p class="vision-para"><i>
      Vision statement is articulating our dreams and hopes for our business. It reminds us of what we are 
      trying to build. Our Leadership Signature is ultimately about creating a way for people to contribute 
      to making something extraordinary happen. A continuous improvement process for us is an ongoing effort 
      to improve products, services and processes. These efforts can seek "incremental" improvement over time 
      or "breakthrough" improvement all at once. Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated 
      and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.
